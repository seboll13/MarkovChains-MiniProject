### Markov Chains and Algorithmic Applications - Final Mini Project
The goal of this project is to impement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to solve the $N$-queens problem. The algorithm is based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Ultimately, we will be able to approximate the number of placement solutions there exists for large $N$.
